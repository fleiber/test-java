/**
 * Implementation adapted from https://github.com/tdebatty/java-string-similarity.
 *
 * The Levenshtein distance, or edit distance, between two words is the
 * minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or
 * substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
 *
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
 *
 * It is always at least the difference of the sizes of the two strings.
 * It is at most the length of the longer string.
 * It is zero if and only if the strings are equal.
 * If the strings are the same size, the Hamming distance is an upper bound
 * on the Levenshtein distance.
 * The Levenshtein distance verifies the triangle inequality (the distance
 * between two strings is no greater than the sum Levenshtein distances from
 * a third string).
 *
 * Implementation uses dynamic programming (Wagnerâ€“Fischer algorithm), with
 * only 2 rows of data. The space requirement is thus O(m) and the algorithm
 * runs in O(mn).
 *
 * @param s1 The first string to compare.
 * @param s2 The second string to compare.
 * @param limit The maximum result to compute before stopping. This
 * means that the calculation can terminate early if you
 * only care about strings with a certain similarity.
 * Set this to Integer.MAX_VALUE if you want to run the
 * calculation to completion in every case.
